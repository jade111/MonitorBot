MonitorBot is a robot designed to autonomously patrol your house while you're not home.
It not only streams video to your phone, but it also has a thermal camera to allow the user to check for leaks inside walls as well
as view if their doors are not sealed or their refrigerator is left open.  All these features will be available from anywhere in the world
through an encrypted VPN tunnel

Current Progress:
The robot hosts a local internet server that is connected to by the android application.  The user can view the video feed from the phone
as well as drive the robot around while in close proximity to it.
There is also code for a server that will allow the robot to be accessed from anywhere, but this is currently not implemented


MonitorBot是一款可以在你不在家的时候自动在家巡逻的机器人。它不仅可以将视频传输到你的手机上，它还有一个热摄像头，可以让用户检查墙壁内部是否有泄漏，还可以查看他们的门是否没有密封，或者他们的冰箱是否开着。所有这些功能都可以通过加密的VPN隧道从世界任何地方获得。目前的进展是:机器人托管一个本地互联网服务器，由android应用程序连接到该服务器。用户可以从手机上查看视频，并在靠近机器人时驱动它四处走动。还有一个服务器的代码，允许机器人从任何地方访问，但目前还没有实现
